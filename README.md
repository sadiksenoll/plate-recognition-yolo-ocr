# Plate Recognition with YOLO + OCR

License plate detection and recognition demo project (work in progress).

## Goal
Build a clear, step-by-step pipeline for plate recognition that can later be used on images, videos, and IP camera/RTSP streams.

## Planned Pipeline
1. Plate detection with YOLO
2. Plate crop + preprocessing (OpenCV)
3. OCR with EasyOCR / Tesseract
4. Post-processing for TR plates (cleanup/format)
5. Logging (CSV / SQLite)

## Tech Stack
Python, OpenCV, YOLO, EasyOCR/Tesseract

## Status
🚧 Initial repository setup. Implementation will be added step-by-step.

## Run
Will be updated once the first script is added.
